                    People who walk around instead of relying on vehicular transportation may at some point feel uncertain 
about the safety of the street they are walking in, especially if they are new to the area. Having no clue 
where dangerous areas are located increases the vulnerability of individuals that may not have the 
option of having a quick getaway car nearby to escape potentially dangerous situations.
